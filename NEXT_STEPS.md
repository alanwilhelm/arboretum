  - Implemented batch_results table and schema
  - Built BatchResults context for storing responses
  - Added batch operations LiveView UI

- ✅ **LLM Integration**
  - Implemented LLMClient with provider abstraction
  - Added simulated provider for testing
  - Integrated with OpenAI API
  - Built error handling and retries

- ✅ **Rate Limiting**
  - Implemented provider-specific rate limits
  - Added configurable backoff strategies
  - Created rate limit buckets by model
  - Built monitoring for rate-limited operations

- ✅ **Web Interface**
  - Created agent management LiveView components
  - Built batch operation UI
  - Added result viewing interface
  - Enhanced navigation and home page
